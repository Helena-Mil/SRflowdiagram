Description: Evidence reviews (including systematic reviews and maps) should 
    be described in a high degree of methodological detail. An integral 
    part of the methodological description of a review is a flow driagram. 
    This package produces an interactive flow diagram using a .Rhtml document 
    to output an interactive .html file that can be added as a static image 
    to a review report or embedded within a project website as an interactive 
    visualisation of the review process. When interactive, the user can click 
    on each box and be directed to another website or file online (e.g. a 
    detailed description of the screeeing methods, or a list of excluded full 
    texts), with a mouseover tool tip that describes the information linked 
    to in more detail. One version ('SRflowdiagram.Rhtml') allows the user to 
    specify the numbers of records at each stage in a code chunk at the start 
    of the .Rhtml file, whilst the other ('SRflowdiagram_import.Rhtml') 
    imports a dataframe of data from a locally stored .csv file.
